# Read Link
This is an **experimental** app for Nextcloud that adds a new context menu action:

* Local files and directories: Display local filesystem path. (i.e. `/var/www/nextcloud/data/user/files/foo.bar`)
* Files and directories at external storages: Display URL. (i.e. `smb://example.net/share/foo.bar`)

Shared files and directories located at external storages are **not** supported at the moment!

The app name is a reference to the `readlink` program/function. 😁

## Compatibility
Tested at Nextcloud 24 with PHP 8.0

## Installation
This app is **not** available at the official [App Store](http://apps.nextcloud.com/)!

Maybe I'll upload it in the future. For the moment, just place the folder `readlink` in your `apps` folder.

## Disclaimer
This is my very first app for Nextcloud.

It's just a personal Sunday evening fun project.

Use at your own risk! 😇
